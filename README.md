# DiscordHelper
DiscordHelper is a discord bot that I created to make discord interactions easier.
DiscordHelper started as a summer project meant to make discord meetings more enjoyable. The discord bot can play music, share memes, generate random numbers, tell jokes, and perform basic mathematical operations.
